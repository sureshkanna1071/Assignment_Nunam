## Description

This project involves creating a dynamic dashboard to visualize data using Flask for the backend, React for the frontend, and Plotly for interactive charts. The dashboard displays various visualizations based on user collected.

## Features

- Install the backend dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
- Run the Flask server.

### 2. Set Up the React Frontend

- Open a new terminal window or tab.
- Navigate to the React frontend directory.
- Install the frontend dependencies using `npm install`.
- Run the React development server.

### 3. Access the Application
